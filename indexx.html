	<p class="p">Nobita Nobi a famous television character was actually a real
character, his real name was Nobita Hiroshi who lived in
Japan and was 9 years old. He used to get beaten and
disturbed by his friends as shown on TV.	
Once he found a cat which looked like a racoon dog, he
made him his pet and named him <a href="file:///F:/doraemon.html">Doraemon.</a><br>
<br> Once Doremon
died in a road accident, which made Nobita very sad and
depressed.
He had a disease called Schizophrenia(a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally), which made him give
rise to Doremon as a 22nd-century robot when he was in a
coma.
As it is shown in the TV series Nobita’s life was same
during his coma.
When doctors cured him of coma, he asked that where was
Doremon… his parents said Doremon is dead and he was a
cat, not a robot.
He used to narrate his life with Doremon to the doctors, but
they said he was in a coma for months and Doremon was a
fragment of his imagination.
This made him very depressed again that whom he used to
stay with shared his sorrow and laughed together was simply
a fragment of his imagination <br>

<br>
When he was 16 years his depression made him shoot him
and commit suicide due to his mental pain.
